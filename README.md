# Vietnamese Handwritten Text Recognition - Cinnamon AI Challenge

This implementation follows Do Hai Minh's [github](https://github.com/dhminh1024/htr_vietnamese) closely and adapts from [@pbcquoc](https://pbcquoc.github.io/vietnamese-ocr/). Our version of Quoc's model does not perform as well as Minh's due to the fact that we did not implement Beam Search that Quoc has implemented.

The data can be download at [Cinnamon AI Challenge](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Qa2YA6w6V5MaNV-qxqhsHHoYFRK5JB39)

Please unzip the data in this folder structure to run the code:

```
|--data/
|----raw/
|------0825_DataSamples_1/
|------0916_DataSamples_2/
|------1015_Private_Test/
|--src/
```


### Data preprocessing

Move to `/src` and run this to transform the data

```
python transform.py --path ../data/raw/0916_DataSamples_2 --type train --transform
python transform.py --path ../data/raw/1015_Private_Test --type test --transform
```

Two new folders `train/` and `test/` and two `json` files containing the labels will be created in `data/`. The folders `train/` and `test/` contain the preprocessed images. You can also run

```
python transform.py --path ../data/raw/0825_DataSamples_1 --type val --transform
```

to create a `val/` set with 15 samples.

**Showing examples**

```
python transform.py --type [train or test or val] --sample
```
This will open a OpenCV window showing the preprocessed images (50 samples) one by one. The labels of the images will be shown in the terminal window.

### Model training

You can train with three different models, Minh's model (achieving WER 0.188 and SER 0.89), Quoc's model or combined model (convolution layers from Minh's and Quoc's attention layers)

For Minh's model (consisting of convolutional layers and bidirectional LSTM):

```
python train.py --train
```
or for combined model:
```
python train.py --trainattn
```
or for Quoc's model (base model VGG16, attention layer and bidirectional LSTM):
```
python train.py --trainquoc
```
Every time training or testing is done, stats will be saved in `train_stats.txt` or `evaluate_stats.txt`

For testing on Minh's and combined model, run:

```
python train.py --test --path [path to the test images]
```
or testing on Quoc's model (because of different base layer input shape):
```
python train.py --testquoc --path [path to the test images]
```

Example `python3 train.py --test --path ../data/test`. Then predicted texts and the ground true texts will be stored in `predictions_test.txt`.
